Weyland-Yutani IO communication system

## Principles

The WY Monitor OS allows multiple distant entities (HQ, colonial bases, planetary detention complex, etc.) to communicate using Secured Communication Beams.

Any entity can connect to any known beam using a beam name and beam code. Once connected, the entity can recieve and send direct messages trough the beam using its personal id.\
All messages are stored in a secure database accessible via the beam name and code (Old and unread messages can be accessed).\

The WY Monitor OS requires at least one beam to be connected.

Make sure to keep you beam access codes in case of a beam disconnection.

## Usage
 - Open the monitor system
 - Press "Enter" to boot Monitor OS
 - When asked enter your `personal id`
 - At first boot, the OS asks for a beam connection
   - Enter the `beam name` and `beam code` when required
 - Once connected you can recieve and send messages trough the beam
 - press "b" to connect other beams
 - press "d" to disconnect from beams
 - press "h" for help
 
(Input commands can be canceled using `CTRL`+ `c`)
